	%	ask you to choose among a list they prepared for you.)
	%	(Preferences information?)
	%	(Criteria...)
	% 	(You search the product details online, and compile them
	%	into a table.)
	% fig. Evaluation Matrix n°1
	%	(Introduce context problem)
	%	(Naturally ordered numeric criteria)
	% 0. Choice: which is the best according to you? Why? What are the trade-offs?
	% 	(Introductory question, to analyse the criteria)
	% 1. Pareto Dominance
	%	(Apply Pareto Dominance)
	% fig. Evaluation Matrix n°2: changed values so Pareto dominance is not applicable
	%	(non ordered criteria)
	%	(consult with expert/friend, added non ordered criteria, e.g. brand, size, etc.)
	% 2.
	% 	2.a Can you still apply Pareto Dominance? 
	%	Would the decision be the same for someone else ?
	%		(Yes/No. Non-ordered criteria, no.
	%		Choice is personal, you rank the criteria)
	% 	txt. Since the choice is yours, you order the criteria.
	% 	2.b. Order the non ordered criteria
	% 3. Solve the problem using an aggregation procedure.
	%	3.a. Rank the criteria
	%		(lexicographic, i.e. rank criteria)
	%	3.b. Assign weights to the criteria
	%		(weighted sum, i.e. weight criteria)
	% 	(change all objectives to identical ones)
	% 4. Do you think the decision makes sense? Explain wrt to the aggregation procedures, and the criteria.
	%	(Introduce common sense, and examine the aggregation/criteria)
	%	(Does the ranking make sense? How do you obtain weights?)
	%	(What "real" consequences does the decision have?)
	% fig. Product photos
	% 5. Does the product design influence your choice? Would you change
	% your decision? Why? Discuss the reasons in group
	%	(Introduce missing criteria, product personality)
	%	(Open question, introduce another subjective criteria,
	%	and showcase the importance of product design
	%	and how it fits "your personality")

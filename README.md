# AOS4 - Decision under Uncertainty and MCDM - Assignments

## Exercice creation or "being in a TA shoes"

> In this first assignment, each student should create one exercice in relation 
to the course (it can concern any part of the course, either on 
multi-objective/multi-criteria optimisation or on decision under uncertainty), 
that either emphasizes some aspect of the course, allows one to practice some 
of its aspects, or investigate a topic connected to the course, but that we did 
not explore. Each student would then be in the shoe of a teaching assistant 
(TA) in charge of producing exercices for practical/training classes or 
courses. What we expect as a result of this assignment is the following:

> The exercise statement, presenting the problem to be solved and the various 
associated questions and sub-questions (there can be only one main 
question/statement, or multiple follow-up questions).
> A detailed solution of the exercise (not just the end result), so that another 
TA (or ourselves) can reuse the exercise easily
> An short explanation (it can be a single paragraph or more) of the pedagogical 
purpose of the exercise: to practice some technical aspects, to illustrate a 
particular point, to make the student discover new concepts, etc... in short, 
after having done this exercise, what would be the gain of the student?
> Students are allowed to communicate/exchange ideas of exercises and even build 
them together. However, at the end, we expect EACH student to provide a 
different exercise (numerical variations of the same exercise will not be 
considered as different exercises).

## Paper illustration or "explain to your high-school nephew"

> In this second assignment, each group (of maximum 3 people, minimum 1) will 
take a paper (a non-exhaustive and regularly updated list can be found at the 
end of the page) and will have the task to illustrate/explain a part of the 
paper through a media of their choice: it can be a presentation, a video, a 
poster, a live demonstration/exercise, an interactive website, etc. The rules 
are as follows:

> The illustration/explanation should be pedagogical, in the sense that it should 
be accessible to a non-expert (that does not know advanced maths or computing). 
It should not be too long (i.e., less than 10/15 minutes).
> Depending on the size and complexity of the paper, not all of it has to be 
explained/illustrated. It is better to focus on a specific part and be really 
pedagogical/illustrative than trying to show too much and be confusing.
> If needed, students are encouraged to also look at connected papers to better 
understand their links.Â 
> Each group must take a different paper. The rule is first come, first served 
(each time a group chooses a paper and tells us so, this paper is no longer 
available).
